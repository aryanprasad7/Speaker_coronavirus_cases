# Speaker_coronavirus_cases
An assistant which speaks the covid cases in countries
I have used an open source web scraping tool known as ParseHub to gather information from a site (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). This tool helps me scrape the websites easily and then creates an API, which i have used in my code.
This project was inspired from Tim Russica who runs a youtube channel named Tech with Tim.
